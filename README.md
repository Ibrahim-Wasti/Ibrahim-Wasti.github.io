## Data Analytics Portfolio by Ibrahim Wasti

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I used for exploratory data analysis, dashboard creation, and building models. Each section will have different projects.

Project done for class, an analysis of sales for 2019 of an e-commerce company. Merged 12 files of sales data into one dataframe using the OS and Pandas libraries. Visualizations were created using MatPlotLib. Answered different questions to gain insights into the data and come to conclusions that would effect the company's strategy in marketing and staffing.

This was a dataset which provided information on different aspects of the content on Netflix, from the director and cast to the availability by country. Tasks were to show top acotrs/directors, top countries by number of productions, amount of content for each age group, etc. All these questions were answered uding a combination of Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The general datset and more information can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).
